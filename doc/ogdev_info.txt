Here is what we did with the base AWS image to get it to where it currently is:

Lower the security level on IE so you can actually browse and download application to install:

Change timezone to EST in control panel

Install chocolatey (used to install other tools quickly from command prompt)
https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation
Paste this into command prompt to install chocolatey:
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin


Chocolatey installs from command prompt:
cinst GoogleChrome
cinst MobaXTerm
cinst notepadplusplus
cinst KickAssVim  (FYI-there were errors on the console, but it seems to work fine.)
cinst tortoisesvn 
cinst strawberryperl

Do java 7_u25 (higher causes a liferay issue?)
Do latest liferay
Do latest spring sts

open vpn setup:
* you can only have 1 instance of a vpn user working at a time so get an extra vpn login like 'rparks2' for aws machine.

svn setup:
* paste svn://172.10.10.60/onegate into windows explorer and it pops svn repo browser
* do full checkout to D:\onegate 
* should end up with paths like D:\onegate\trunk and D:\onegate\branches etc

give spring tool suite more memory in STS.ini:
-Xms256m
-Xmx2048m
-XX:MaxPermSize=1024

-------------- 01/14/2014 --------------

1. Downloaded 4 Siebel Tools and Web Client zip files to C:\SiebelInstallZipFiles
	- V36457-01_1of2.zip
	- V36457-01_2of2.zip
	- V36458-01_1of2.zip
	- V36458-01_2of2.zip

2. Downloaded Siebel Image Creator file (V31103-01.zip) to C:\SiebelInstallZipFiles
3. Downloaded Oracle Database Client Installation zip file (win32_11gR2_client.zip) to C:\SiebelInstallZipFiles

4. Extracted jar files for Siebel tools, Web Client and Image Creator to C:\8.2.2.0SiebelJARs
5. Extracted Oracle Database Client installation folder to C:\SiebelInstallZipFiles

6. Created a Siebel installation image at C:\Siebel_Install_Image. This provides the installation files for Siebel Tools and Web Client. These
   installers use the jar files extracted in step 4.
	
7. Installed the Oracle Database Client at C:\app. This is required to allow connectivity to any Oracle Database.
8. Using the files in the Siebel installation image, installed Siebel Tools and Web Client to C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0

9. Edited C:\app\Administrator\product\11.2.0\client_1\network\admin\tnsnames.ora, creating a database address source for Siebel DEV2 as "SBLDEV".
10. Edited C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Tools_1\BIN\ENU\tools.cfg to point to 172.10.10.125 (Siebel DEV2)
11. Added an ODBC Data Source for SBLDEV at C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe
12. At this stage, using Siebel tools it was possible to log in directly to the Siebel DEV2 server using SADMIN/SADMIN123 as credentials and selecting "Server" from
	the drop down at log in. It	took around 6-7 minutes to log in directly to the server this way. Given that development does
	not occur directly on the Server, it was necessary to set up a local environment for development.

13. To set up a database to allow for local Siebel development, a new database was generated and then extracted in the Siebel UI for user "ONEGATEUSER"
14. To set up local Siebel tools, attempted to log in using ONEGATEUSER/ONEGATEUSERPASS, selecting "Local" from the drop down at log in. This began a process of extracting the 
	database generated in step 13. , setting up the local dev environment. After this, it was possible to log in to Siebel Tools using ONEGATEUSER/ONEGATEUSERPASS and "Local" as the source.
	NOTE: ONEGATEUSER/ONEGATEUSERPASS will be the credentials that any developer will use for local development on this machine.
	
15. Downloaded Tortoise SVN, making sure that the SVN command line tools were included within the installation so that auto check out/check in of Siebel objects could occur in
	Siebel Tools.
	
16. Edited C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Tools_1\BIN\srcctrl.bat to allow for SVN Check Out/Check In's in Siebel tools. SVN username/password set to OneGate/OneGate.
17. Edited the registry to add 4 required parameters using the following steps:

	1. Start -> Run -> Regedit
	2. HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> ODBC -> SBLDEV
	3. Added 4 new String values: EnableScrollableCursors (Value 0) , PacketSize (Value = 0), ColumnsAsChar (Value = 1), ColumnSizeAsCharacter (Value = 1)

	At this stage, check out/check in of objects to SVN (and addition of files to D:/onegate) was verified as working correctly. HOWEVER, it is important to note that any
	developer using this machine will have to edit the SVN username/password (currently OneGate/OneGate) in C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Tools_1\BIN\srcctrl.bat to identify their check in's.

18.	To set up the Siebel Web Client, the local database file (sse_data.dbf) was copied from C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Tools_1\LOCAL to C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Client_1\LOCAL

19. Edited C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Client_1\BIN\ENU\publicsector.cfg. Changed field ServerDbODBCDataSource in the [Siebel] section, the values ConnectString, TableOwner, GatewayAddress, 
	EnterpriseServer in the [ServerDataSrc] section and the values ConnectString and EnterpriseServer in [GatewayDataSrc]

19. Went to ODBC data source at C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe -> System DSN Tab. Selected "SEAW Local Db default instance" and clicked configure. Went to the database tab,
	and removed all of the information in the Server Name and Start Line text boxes. Clicked "Browse" beside the database file name and navigated to
	C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Client_1\LOCAL, making sure that the value in this field reads C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Client_1\LOCAL\sse_data.dbf
	
20. Still in ODBC Data Source, went to the Login tab, and entered credentials ONEGATEUSER/ONEGATEUSERPASS. Tested this connection in the ODBC tab and this was successful.

21. Edited C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Client_1\WEBTEMPL to include 4 OneGate specific .swt files

22. Edited the properties of the Siebel Web Client Shortcut for default (a)username  (b)password and (c)datasource ( (a) ONEGATEUSER, (b) ONEGATEUSERPASS, (c) ServerDataSrc)

23. Replaced the SRF file at C:\Siebel\8.2.2.0.0\Client_1\OBJECTS\ENU. Using the shortcut, "Siebel Public Sector - ENU" (which is the web client), the Siebel UI was succesfully loaded.
